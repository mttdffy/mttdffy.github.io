      I work to build scalable and maintainable applications. I've worked for clients ranging from small, one-man startups to large corporations. I started my career as a designer but quickly realized my true passion was bringing ideas to life through development. My focus is back-end development and architecture, but I have experience across the entire spectrum of software development.

    <p>
      I'm currently a rails developer at <a href="http://www.weblinc.com">WebLinc</a>, part of the product team working to continually improve our commerce platform, <a href="https://www.workarea.com" >Workarea</a>. In another life I was a designer and a teacher, occasionally teaching courses at <a href="http://drexel.edu">Drexel University</a> for their Digital Media program.
